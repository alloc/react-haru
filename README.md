> Declarative animations with spring

**ATTN:** This is a fork of `react-spring` by its former lead maintainer, @aleclarson. This package likely contains *less* bugs than `react-spring` and is *more* actively maintained, since it is backed by a new license that charges for commercial purposes, while non-commercial use remains free, as well as commercial use by teams of 3 or less. Please read the `LICENSE.md` file for more information.
